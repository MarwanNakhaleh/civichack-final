# Indy Civic Hack

## Using the `converter`

### Dependencies

You will need Node.js installed. I used v6.2.1, but the code should be backwards compatible quite a ways.

### Setup

Simply `cd` into the `converter` directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running

**The script assumes you have a file named `IMPD_UCR_2014_Data.csv`, and want to create a new file from it named `IMPD_UCR_2014_Data_NEW.csv`. If this is incorrect, please change this in `index.js` prior to running.**

Simply run:
```bash
node index.js
```
